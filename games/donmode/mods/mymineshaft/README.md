# mymineshaft

This mod adds vertical mineshafts to Minetest. 

Craft a machine and build mine shaft pieces. When you go mining you can dig a hole straight down. Place the mineshaft and you can climb up  and down.

This mod also adds abandoned mine shafts. When you go mining you will find these shafts.
