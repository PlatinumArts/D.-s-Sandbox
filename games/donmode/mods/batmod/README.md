======
Batman Mod is a mod created so I could learn how to make mods. It is a combination of my work and the work of
many others. I want to thank everyone who works to make Minetest a better game. 
If I have used your code and did not give credit or if I was not allowed to use the code please let me know.
I neglected to keep track of whos work I was using. I mean no disrespect. Sorry!
The Batman mod is licened under "DWYWPL"
