# D.s-Sandbox
D.'s Sandbox - An open source free Minecraft / InfiniMiner like game based off the wonderful Minetest engine that is school friendly.  It will also serve as the base for D. The Atom Shifter.  Check http://SandboxGameMaker.com for more info.

The main goal will be to add the features that I feel are lacking in other similar games and to improve the modding API which is already fantastic.  The focus is on fun and creativity!
